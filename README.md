# Appvia Hub

[![Build_Status](https://circleci.com/gh/appvia/appvia-hub.svg?style=svg&circle-token=ea303efa15990d76dc61bbbed4e4b634b578299f)](https://circleci.com/gh/appvia/appvia-hub)

## Docs

Please refer to https://appvia.github.io/appvia-hub/ for the documentation.

## Preview / QA

These instructions allow you to quickly run the Hub in docker.

**Note** the container is built locally and the hub is run with the production rails environment so this isn't suitable for development.

**Note** for development, you will need to run the steps for [Dev](#dev) below.

Run the command:
```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-app-preview.yml up
```

The hub should then be available at http://localhost:3000

## Dev

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 2.5.7
  - with Bundler v1.17+
  - Postgres client ([platform lib required](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6040583/cant-find-the-libpq-fe-h-header-when-trying-to-install-pg-gem?answertab=votes#tab-top))
- NodeJS 10+
  - with Yarn 1.10+
- Docker Compose v1.23+

### Dependent services

A database, mock user service and auth proxy can all be run locally using Docker Compose, using the provided `docker-compose.yml`.

Note for linux users you can use `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-linux.yml <commands>`. This is required due to the current lack of support for `host.docker.internal` in [Docker for Linux](https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/264).

To start them all up (running in the background):

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

To shut them all down:

```shell
docker-compose down
```

### Initial setup

Once you have the prerequisites above, the codebase cloned and the dependent services running locally…

Set up the following environment variables in `.env.local` (you'll need to create this file initially):
- `SECRET_KEY_BASE` – used for encryption. Usually 128 bytes. You can run `bin/rails secret` locally to generate a string for this.
- `SECRET_SALT` – a separate [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) value used for things like model attribute encryption.

Then run the following to set everything up:

```bash
bin/setup
```

Then you're ready to use the usual `rails` commands (like `bin/rails serve`) to run / work with the app. See the [Rails CLI guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html) for details.

### Running the app locally

#### Web app server

Start up the Rails server with:

```shell
bin/rails server
```

This serves the entire app, including all frontend assets (bundled using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)).

You can **also** run `bin/webpack-dev-server` in a separate terminal shell if you want live reloading (in your browser) of CSS and JavaScript changes (note: only changes made within the `app/webpack` folder will cause live reloads).

#### Tests

To run the test suite:

```shell
bundle exec rspec
```

Note: A test coverage report is generated by SimpleCov as part of the test suite run. Results are shown at the end of the test run, and you can also view the full report by opening: `coverage/index.html`.

#### Code linting/formatting and security checks

To run Rubocop (for code linting/formatting):

```shell
bundle exec rubocop
```

To run Brakeman (for security checks):

```shell
bundle exec brakeman
```

… both of these run as part of the CircleCI build.

#### Background workers

Certain tasks – such as resource provisioning – are carried out in background jobs using [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq).

There are different background workers for different types of jobs:

- One for **resource provisioning** specifically:
  - **IMPORTANT:** MUST run with a concurrency of 1 (`-c 1`) to ensure proper FIFO processing.
  - `bundle exec sidekiq -q resources -c 1`
- One for **teams** processing specifically:
  - **IMPORTANT:** MUST run with a concurrency of 1 (`-c 1`) to ensure proper FIFO processing.
  - `bundle exec sidekiq -q teams -c 1`
- One for **admin tasks** specifically:
  - `bundle exec sidekiq -q admin_tasks -c 2`

### Dev tips

To get Rubocop to fix detected issues automatically (where it can):

```shell
bundle exec rubocop -a
```

If you get the error `Invalid single-table inheritance type: […]` just restart your local server. This is due to single-table inheritance and lazy loading of files during development.
