# Who Is The Hub For

The Hub is aimed primarily for Developers and is aimed at a mix of single flat project teams and large organisations  who require a consistent way of working across many disperse projects.

## Why Would I Use It?

If you want to abstract some of the tedious repeatability of provisioning resources away, then this would be something you would use. If you are a tiny team and are not provisioning many resources, due to having very few applications, then it may be that you are in a position to manage this manually or through a very small code footprint and hence you may use it for more enforcing best practices and having standardisation across what you are creating within the team.
